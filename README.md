# Movie Ticket Management System

Movie Ticket Management System is just like any other ticket booking system
wherein you can buy a movie ticket at a specific price in a specific hall , for a specific
time slot for desired number of people and you can even cancel it if you do not wish
to watch the movie. In case, there is a special movie screening you can pre-book the
tickets as well. There is a specific menu for the admins wherein they can sign in and
set the movie price as per the demand/sales of the tickets. If there are no tickets
available for a particular movie then the customers can put themselves on a waiting
list so when another customer who has already bought a ticket cancels it then the
customer in the waiting list can get the ticket. The customer can also reserve the
seat they desire by viewing the seat pattern along with their desired food. There will
be a menu for admins as well where the admin can change the price of the tickets as
per their demand/sales.
